[2] Acquired by Alexander A. Cowan [1867-1955], England/Nigeria, in or after 1897; [3] (sale, Sotheby’s, London, 5-6 July 1954, no. 82). (J.J. Klejman Gallery, New York); purchased around 30 November 1955 by Winston Guest, New York; gift 1955 to NGA.

[1] The sculpture cannot be precisely dated but is thought to have been made during the eighteenth century. It would have belonged to the ruling Oba, and then passed by descent to succeeding Obas. 

[2] According to the Sotheby’s, London, sales catalog of 5-6 July 1954, the object was “acquired by the present owner following on the Benin punitive expedition of 1897.”

[3] Cowan was a merchant from Liverpool who spent his career working for trading firms based in Nigeria. Although not known to have been a member of the British Punitive Expedition of 1897, he was possibly in Nigeria in 1897 (or shortly after) and may have come into possession of the object around that time through a member of the Expedition.

[1] The Duveen Brothers Records document the firm’s sixteen year pursuit and eventual acquisition of the Dreyfus collection, which included paintings, sculptures, small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes. Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929. Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.

[1] The dealer Jacques Goudstikker fled Amsterdam with his wife and son in May 1940, and died in an accident on board the ship on which he left. He left behind most of his gallery's stock of paintings, including the Ruysdael, and with the rest of the Goudstikker paintings, it was confiscated by the Nazis later the same year and delivered to Hermann Göring; see _Rapport inzake de Kunsthandel v.h J Goudstikker NV in oprichtung per 13 September 1940_, Beilage III, Staat van Schilderijen, gekocht M Goering van de ""oude"" Goudstikker, Access no. 1341, inv. 103, Gemeentearchief, Amsterdam. The painting was recovered by the Allies at the end of World War II and held at the Munich Central Collecting Point (where it was no. 5324), before being returned to the Netherlands in 1948. In the Netherlands, ownership was transferred among several museums, during which time the painting maintained the identifying inventory number NK 2347: Stichting Nederlands Kunstbezit, The Hague, in 1948; Dienst voor's Rijks Verspreide Kunstvoorwerpen, The Hague, 1948-1975; Dienst Verspreide Rijkscollecties, The Hague, 1975-1985; Rijksdienst Beeldende Kunst, The Hague, 1985-1997; and Instituut Collectie Nederland, Amsterdam, in 1997. Physical custody of the painting was transferred in 1960 to the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, where it had the inventory number SK A 3983 and where it remained until 2006. In 2005, the Dutch Advisory Committee on the Assessment of Restitution Applications for Items of Cultural Value and the Second World War recommended in favor of the Goudstikker family's claim for the return of this and other paintings that had been confiscated in 1940. The surviving heirs were Marei von Saher, the widow of Goudstikker's son, Edward, and her daughters, Charlène and Chantel, who received the restituted paintings in early 2006.

Kress Collection,Painting,,0.0,,,0.0,5988.0,4812.0,,204.0,"In a room with avocado-green walls, three people cluster around and support a noticeably pale young woman who leans back on a pillow, as an older man looks on in this horizontal painting. All the people have light skin, gray or white hair, and wear long, voluminous dresses or robes. The woman and pillow are held in place by the two men and one woman around her. The swooning woman’s heavily lidded eyes are barely open, and her thin lips are closed. Her left hand, to our right, rests gently on her breast, while her other hand hangs limply by her side. Her pastel-pink gown is open down the front over a milky white, low-cut chemise and a pale yellow underskirt. Wide, lace ruffles hang from her elbow-length sleeves, and she wears white stockings and white, low-heeled shoes. The white pillow is edged with a pink ribbon tied into bows at the corners. Directly behind her, a man with long, curly, gray hair looks down at the woman’s pale face and a second man, to our right, looks off in that direction as he braces her body. The second man has curly, flax-blond hair and wears a daffodil-yellow robe. One black shoe with a silver buckle pokes out under the hem. To our left, a woman slightly bends over the swooning woman, facing our right in profile. Her low cap or head scarf is lined with flowers at the back of her head over steel gray hair. She wears a teal-blue, satin gown with wide, sheer cuffs over her forearms. The front of her low-cut bodice is lined with a textured, lemon-yellow material. Her right fingertips, closer to us, brush the top of the glass vial she holds in her other hand. To our right and a bit apart from the group, an older man faces the swooning woman in profile, stooping slightly, and gestures toward her with one hand. His long, wavy, gray hair falls to mid-back and some sweeps over his shoulder, nearly reaching his waist. He wears a marine-blue robe with white cuffs. The wall behind the group is covered with green wallpaper with a floral motif picked out in moss green against the lighter background. Shamrock-green curtains hang along the right edge of the painting, possibly over a door. A honey-yellow sofa with fringed upholstery sits along the wall to our left, extending off that edge of the painting. A black tricorn hat and piece of rumpled, white fabric sit at the center of the sofa, which overlaps the corner of a wooden mantle. A chubby, baby-like, winged putto seems to stand on the mantle, holding up the edge of a gold frame, presumably of a painting hanging over the fireplace. A blue and white vase sits near the putto on the mantle. To our left, in front of the sofa, a round gaming table is toppled onto the muted, marigold-orange floor. The surface of the table is mottled with areas of cream white, pale yellow, royal blue, and sage green that could represent people, possibly in a landscape. Coins spill from a carnation-red purse near a deck of cards scattered on the floor near the upended table.",1490.0,1.0,500023454.0,"Longhi, Pietro",Pietro Longhi,Longhi,Italian,individual,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/7d474cb1-a34a-4f4f-8df3-f62166b446ac/full/full/0/default.jpg,0.045246992477535,Italy,IT,Europe

[1] Ruth Fine, former Rosenwald curator, found no record of purchase for this object but suggested the Rosenwalds might have acquired it on their round-the-world trip in 1958 (conversation with Alison Luchs, NGA curator, 26 August 1983). Their account of that trip (Edith and Lessing Rosenwald, _Writing Paper Back_, [privately printed, 1958]) includes no visit to Africa or mention of the relief, although the book rarely discusses purchases. Elizabeth Mongan, an earlier Rosenwald curator, had never seen the relief and suggested that it must have been acquired after she left the position in 1962 (telephone conversation, 13 March 1985).",Rosenwald Collection,Sculpture,,0.0,,,1.0,8324.0,11654.0,,47212.0,,2100.0,1.0,,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian,anonymous,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/18cee2f1-0a8b-4443-a387-f05324497f8b/full/full/0/default.jpg,9.756763876557424e-06,Ethiopia,ET,Africa

Kress Foundation, New York;[1] gift 1957 to NGA.


[1] The Duveen Brothers Records document the firm’s sixteen year pursuit and eventual acquisition of the Dreyfus collection, which included paintings, sculptures, small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes. Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929. Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.

Rosenwald; [1] gift 1950/1951 to the National Gallery of Art. 

[1] In _Recollections of a Collector_, 1976, p. 56-57, Rosenwald described being approached by a young man in South America who offered to sell his father’s collection of prints that he had brought with him from Germany. Rosenwald gives the year as 1951, but his appointment books confirm that it was actually 1950 - he left for Buenos Aires on 9 February 1950 and returned on 20 March 1950 (Library of Congress, Rosenwald Papers, Box 75). Rosenwald writes that he bought the entire collection of some 1100 prints and drawings, but as they had already been scheduled to be sent to Europe they came to the United States via Antwerp, arriving in the US in late April 1950. Rosenwald decided to keep about a quarter of the collection, destined for the National Gallery of Art, and donate the remainder to other institutions. The inventory log of Alverthorpe indicates that just over 300 works were accessioned there in May of 1950, inventory numbers 50.260-50.530, acquired from Claude Schaefer (Gallery Archives, National Gallery of Art, RG 45A1, Rosenwald Papers, Box 41).",Rosenwald Collection,Print,39961.0,0.0,Trabrennen,Trabrennen [1951.10.168-180],0.0,4000.0,3219.0,640.0,39966.0,,3076.0,1.0,500016330.0,"Slevogt, Max",Max Slevogt,Slevogt,German,individual,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/eb2ed548-045d-46fe-80c0-466477aa0f81/full/full/0/default.jpg,0.0407637594762569,Germany,DE,Europe

[1] Details about the formation of the antiquities collection acquired by William Clark are in the Clark collection records, in NGA curatorial files. Collin was a painter, and a student of Greek history and archaeology, who had the advice of Edmond Pottier in assembling the collection. Pottier was a director of the French School of Archaeology in Athens, and curator of the Greek and Roman department at the Louvre in Paris. The works in the collection were mostly made originally for household use, then found their way into tombs in ancient Greece, as belongings of the deceased or as offerings at the time of burial.",Corcoran Collection (William A.

[1] Ruth Fine, former Rosenwald curator, found no record of purchase for this object but suggested the Rosenwalds might have acquired it on their round-the-world trip in 1958 (conversation with Alison Luchs, NGA curator, 26 August 1983). Their account of that trip (Edith and Lessing Rosenwald, _Writing Paper Back_, [privately printed, 1958]) includes no visit to Africa or mention of the relief, although the book rarely discusses purchases. Elizabeth Mongan, an earlier Rosenwald curator, had never seen the relief and suggested that it must have been acquired after she left the position in 1962 (telephone conversation, 13 March 1985).",Rosenwald Collection,Sculpture,,0.0,,,1.0,8324.0,11654.0,,47212.0,,2100.0,1.0,,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian,anonymous,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/18cee2f1-0a8b-4443-a387-f05324497f8b/full/full/0/default.jpg,9.756763876557424e-06,Ethiopia,ET,Africa

[2] Acquired by Alexander A. Cowan [1867-1955], England/Nigeria, in or after 1897; [3] (sale, Sotheby’s, London, 5-6 July 1954, no. 82). (J.J. Klejman Gallery, New York); purchased around 30 November 1955 by Winston Guest, New York; gift 1955 to NGA.

[1] The sculpture cannot be precisely dated but is thought to have been made during the eighteenth century. It would have belonged to the ruling Oba, and then passed by descent to succeeding Obas. 

[2] According to the Sotheby’s, London, sales catalog of 5-6 July 1954, the object was “acquired by the present owner following on the Benin punitive expedition of 1897.”

[3] Cowan was a merchant from Liverpool who spent his career working for trading firms based in Nigeria. Although not known to have been a member of the British Punitive Expedition of 1897, he was possibly in Nigeria in 1897 (or shortly after) and may have come into possession of the object around that time through a member of the Expedition.

[1] The date of acquisition of the group of paintings by Canaletto at Castle Howard is uncertain. Although the greatest part of the picture collection appears to have been brought together by Frederick, 5th earl of Carlisle (1748-1825), who traveled in Italy in 1768, it is almost certain that the Canalettos were acquired by his father, the 4th earl. Some of these were certainly at Castle Howard by 1745, where they were seen by Lady Oxford in an account of her journey in that year through northern England into Scotland: ""April 27, Saturday. Set out from York for Castle Howard, the seat of the Earl of Carlisle . . . in the drawing-room . . . are several views of Venice by Canaletti lately put up there"" (Finberg, Hilda F., ""Canaletto in England,"" _The Walpole Society_ 9 (1920-1921): 25). The probate inventory taken in 1758 (Castle Howard Archives F4/1) includes several references to ""views of Venice,"" including eighteen in the ""Blue Coffoy Drawing Room."" Moreover, the 5th earl does not record any Canalettos in his list of works of art bought by himself, but does include ""between 30 & 40 views of Venice small"" and ""10 views of Venice Canaletti"" in his list of ""the best pictures at Castle Howard not purchased by me"" (Castle Howard Archives J14/30/2; information from Eeyan Hartley, Keeper of Archives, letter of 7 December 1993). The standard eighteenth- and nineteenth-century descriptions of the Castle Howard paintings collection specify few individual pictures by Canaletto: Neale 1818-1823, 5: n.p., Castle Howard, Yorkshire: ""Eighteen fine views.-Canaletti""; Waagen, Gustav Friedrich, _Treasures of Art in Great Britain_, 3 vols., London, 1854: 3: 323-324, no. 69: ""'A large view of Venice [_The Bacino di San Marco_ (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)].  In every respect one of the best works of the master, whose extraordinary merit can only be appreciated in England.' Nos. 71 88, 'Pictures by Canaletto, some of them very excellent.'"" Henry Howard, 4th earl of Carlisle, made his second visit to Italy in 1738-1739 and was said by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu to have been in Venice in November 1738 (Halsband, Robert, ed., _The Complete Letters of Lady Mary Wortley Montagu_, 3 vols., Oxford, 1965-1967: 1: 127, 148-149).  The family tradition is that the paintings were acquired from Canaletto himself by the 4th earl of Carlisle (undated letter in NGA curatorial files from the 12th and present earl of Carlisle, Naworth Castle, Brampton, Cumbria). According to Browning (Browning, H. Ellen, ""The Canaletto Collection at Castle Howard"", _Art Journal_ 68 (1905): 340) there were, in 1905, four large and nine smaller views by Canaletto in the ""Canaletto Room"" at Castle Howard, as well as eleven smaller works by Marieschi. Three more ""hanging in the music-room and one in Lady Carlisle's drawing-room"" were evidently large pictures by Canaletto. A curious note on the early provenance of the National Gallery's paintings is provided by the inscription (""Bought of Lord Carlisle/ 1825 Gower"") on the reverse of the lining canvas of 1945.15.4, suggesting that the painting was sold by the 5th earl in 1825. (George Granville, baron Gower [1758-1833], became 2d marquess of Stafford in 1803 and 1st duke of Sutherland in 1833. He was one of the syndicate of three, together with his uncle the duke of Bridgewater and the 5th earl of Carlisle, involved with the importation of the Italian pictures from the Orléans collection in France in 1797-1798). The 5th earl died in 1825, so it may be that his son, George, 6th earl of Carlisle (1773-1848) sold the painting after his father's death to assist with the usual financial problems connected with probate. As Eeyan Hartley points out (letter of 7 December 1993 in NGA curatorial files), ""This leaves the puzzle as to when the painting was returned to the Castle Howard collection."" Constable, W. G., _Canaletto: Giovanni Antonio Canal, 1697-1768_, 2nd ed. revised by J. G. Links, 2 vols., Oxford, 1989: 2:nos. 40, 50, 85 [b], 154, 131, 171, 236, 334, discusses eight of the Castle Howard paintings as by Canaletto or his studio. Links, J. G., _Canaletto_, Oxford, 1982: 83-84, noting the uneven quality of the Castle Howard Canalettos, most of which were sold in the late 1930s or destroyed by fire in 1940, suggested that the 4th earl of Carlisle may have employed an agent other than Joseph Smith for his acquisition of paintings by the artist. ""Such an agent may well have had his own sources for view paintings, but he or Lord Carlisle must have gone to Canaletto for three pictures of the collection"": the Washington paintings, signed with the artist's initials, an unheard-of-practice before the 1740s, and the Boston view of the Bacino di San Marco from the Dogana, one of the artist's masterpieces.



[2] Information from the archival house lists of the collections, Castle Howard. For a resumé of the paintings formerly at Castle Howard, see Constable and Links 1989, 2: 203, and note 1. _The Bacino di San Marco_ (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) was acquired in 1939 from Castle Howard through the intermediation of Captain J. Spink, London, who may also have been involved with the sale of the other paintings (information from the Museum of Fine Arts curatorial files).",Gift of Mrs. Barbara Hutton,Painting,,0.0,,,0.0,8360.0,6226.0,,32589.0,"We look slightly down onto a port-side town along a canal, with a church across the water from us in this horizontal landscape painting. A bright blue sky with billowing white, pink, and gray clouds fills the top two-thirds of the painting. Below, a three-masted ship with all but one sail furled is surrounded by a couple dozen black long, low boats, gondolas, and one or two other sailboats. People stand and walk mostly in pairs and trios along the stone walkway under us, which extends into the distance to our right. The women all wear long dresses and most of the men wear suits with knee-length jackets with tails or capes, and hats. The clothing is painted in shades of brick and terracotta red, pine green, royal blue, and gray. The walkway is interrupted by two low walls that partition off an area near us. The angled roofs of stalls line the walkway in the farther distance before it is again interrupted, this time by a two-story, cream-colored building.

Both have pale skin. The woman sits in a wooden chair facing our left in profile, as she cuts a slice into the top of a brown loaf in her lap, presumably bread. Her eyes and downturned mouth are lined with wrinkles, and jowls sag along her jawline. She has slightly protruding eyes and the skin of her neck hangs a little loose. Her head is wrapped in a white, lace-edged scarf, which is gathered at the base of her skull. She wears a white, pleated ruff around her neck, which rests across a brown vest over golden-yellow sleeves. Light shimmers on her slate-gray apron, which drapes over a muted, cinnamon-brown skirt. The toes of black shoes peek out beneath her skirt, propped up on a block. She looks toward the boy who stands at her far knee, to our left. His body is angled toward the woman so his face is in shadow, and he looks down over clasped hands. His fingers are interlaced except for his steepled index fingers. He wears a worn brown jacket with frayed cuffs, and silver buttons down the front. His pants are olive green and his shoes are brown. A plate with a yellow substance sits on a three-legged stool near the woman and boy. Next to it, near the wall to our left, sunlight coming in from that window glints off the wooden spinning wheel. A handful of unspun, white wool sits in a cage atop a staff resting through the spokes of the wheel. Wood beams run across the wooden ceiling and frame the walls.

[1] The sculpture cannot be precisely dated but is thought to have been made during the eighteenth century. It would have belonged to the ruling Oba, and then passed by descent to succeeding Obas. 

[2] According to the Sotheby’s, London, sales catalog of 5-6 July 1954, the object was “acquired by the present owner following on the Benin punitive expedition of 1897.”

[3] Cowan was a merchant from Liverpool who spent his career working for trading firms based in Nigeria. Although not known to have been a member of the British Punitive Expedition of 1897, he was possibly in Nigeria in 1897 (or shortly after) and may have come into possession of the object around that time through a member of the Expedition.

[1] Ruth Fine, former Rosenwald curator, found no record of purchase for this object but suggested the Rosenwalds might have acquired it on their round-the-world trip in 1958 (conversation with Alison Luchs, NGA curator, 26 August 1983). Their account of that trip (Edith and Lessing Rosenwald, _Writing Paper Back_, [privately printed, 1958]) includes no visit to Africa or mention of the relief, although the book rarely discusses purchases. Elizabeth Mongan, an earlier Rosenwald curator, had never seen the relief and suggested that it must have been acquired after she left the position in 1962 (telephone conversation, 13 March 1985).",Rosenwald Collection,Sculpture,,0.0,,,1.0,8324.0,11654.0,,47212.0,,2100.0,1.0,,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian,anonymous,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/18cee2f1-0a8b-4443-a387-f05324497f8b/full/full/0/default.jpg,9.756763876557424e-06,Ethiopia,ET,Africa

Knoedler & Company, Inc., New York); purchased May 1956 by Paul Mellon, Upperville, Virginia; bequest 1999 to NGA.

[1] The artist's heirs were René De Gas, his last surviving brother, who lived in Paris, and the four (of seven) surviving children of his sister Marguerite, who had died in Argentina in 1895.  (His other deceased sister Thérèse left no descendants.) Marguerite's children were: Jeanne Fevre, unmarried and acting on both her own behalf and as the representative of her sister, Madeleine Marie Pauline Fevre, a Carmelite nun; Henri Jean Auguste Marie Fevre, an industrialist who lived in Marseille; and Gabriel Edgar Eugène Fevre, an agent in Montevideo, Uruguay.  See Anne Pingeot and Frank Horvat, _Degas sculptures_, Paris, 1991, and Anne Pingeot, ""The casting of Degas' sculptures: Completing the story,"" _Apollo_ (August 1995): 60-63.



[2] On 13 May 1918 a contract was signed between the artist's heirs and the Hébrard foundry authorizing the reproduction of Degas' sculptures in bronze.  Of the approximately 150 statuettes found in the artist's studio after his death, 74 figures were ultimately cast in bronze.  The contract stipulated that two complete sets were to be cast, one for the heirs and one for the foundry, and authorized a limit of twenty casts of each figure to be offered for sale.  The casting process took at least thirteen years, from 1919 to 1932, and according to the contract, the original figures became the property of the foundry.  See Sara Campbell, ""Degas' bronzes: Introduction,"" _Apollo_ (August 1995): 6-10.



[3] The article by Anne Pingeot referenced in note 1 provides details of the role of Hébrard's daughter in the history of the foundry, and its work in casting the bronzes.

One vase acquired by Thomas B. Clarke [1848-1931], New York; sold 1913 to Peter A. B. Widener.  The other vase acquired by J. Pierpont Morgan [1837-1913], New York, by 1911; sold to (Duveen Brothers, New York and London); sold 1915 to Peter A. B. Widener, Lynnewood Hall, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania; both vases inheritance from Estate of Peter A. B. Widener by gift through power of appointment of Joseph E. Widener, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania;[1] gift 1942 to NGA.

[1] The NGA curatorial records discuss 1942.9.485 and 1942.9.486 together, and note that one was acquired from Clarke, who reportedly obtained it from ""Yan-li San, China, treasurer of Chinese empire,"" while the other was acquired from Duveen, who had obtained it from Morgan.  In _Catalogue of the Morgan Collection of Chinese Porcelains; privately printed by order of Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan_, 2 vols., New York, 1904-1911: 2:82, no. 1340, this piece is said to have come from the imperial collection.  The records, however, do not make clear which vase is which.  A letter dated 1 November 1934 from Duveen Brothers concerning the Morgan piece (in NGA curatorial files), states that Yan Li San might have been a member of the imperial family, noting that Clarke, who worked on the second volume of the Morgan collection, in which this vessel is catalogued, ""may have had means of identifying Yan Li San as a member of the imperial family, but omitted to mention the name in the catalogue.""  This suggests that Duveen Brothers had the impression that both vases had their origin in the same figure, a member of the imperial family.  However, a plausible candiate as the former owner of at least one, if not both, of these vases is the high official of Mongol background, Yang Lishan (c. 1900), who served in the Imperial Household Department (Neiwu Fu).  This might account for imperial associations surrounding the Morgan vase if indeed its origin was also with him.  Eventually Yang became a president of the Board of Revenue (Hubu Shangshu), which could have been interpreted as ""treasurer of the Chinese empire.""  His biography is in Erxun Zhao, et al., _Qing Shigao [Draft Standard History of Qing]_, Taipei, 1981: 18 juan 466, p. 12,763.  Yang was known for what were thought to be proforeign views, and was executed 11 August 1900 after protesting against the encouragement of the antiforeign Boxers.  Only a few days later the Allied Expeditionary Forces entered Beijing.  Perhaps these vases were among the booty reportedly taken from Yang's house by the French missionary Bishop Alphonse Favier (1837-1905), according to The Compilation Group, _History of Modern China: The Yi Ho Tuan Movement of 1900_, Beijing, 1976: 93, and then dispersed, eventually reaching Thomas B. Clarke in the United States along with the somewhat garbled name and occupation of their original owner.  Besides being a collector, Clarke imported and sold Chinese porcelains, and was familiar with Père Favier's collection, as shown in a note in Thomas B. Clarke and George B. Warren, _Catalogue of Antique Chinese Porcelains: Owned by George Warren of Troy, New York, with a note of introduction by Thomas B.

The brushstrokes are loose and visible throughout, making some details difficult to make out. The boxer to our left wears drooping, forest-green trunks and black shoes. He leans back on his bent right leg, closer to us, and tilts his face up. His mouth gapes open and his nose, chin, and neck are smeared with scarlet red, suggesting blood. His pale skin has a green cast, and his chest, arms, and legs are sinewy and muscular. His right arm is raised or pulled up overhead by the boxer to our right. Wearing dark briefs, the second boxer hunches over with head lowered toward the other man’s shoulder. He surges forward onto his deeply bent left knee, closer to us, pushing powerfully off his back leg. His face is lost in shadow and his body has less detail than his opponent, though light glints off his arching back to create gold highlights against his brown skin along his spine, ribs, and muscles of the shoulder. The men’s bodies nearly span the height of the canvas. The black ropes of the boxing ring pass in front of and behind the boxers, and the space around the ring in the top half of the painting is nearly black. Heads and faces of the spectators in the first few rows are lit by the main event and are crowded into the bottom third of the painting. Two spectators on our far left have climbed up and lean on and through the ropes, their mouths open. The crowd, which appears to be all light-skinned men and boys, are painted loosely but their mouths widen in toothy grins or are agape.

[1] Ruth Fine, former Rosenwald curator, found no record of purchase for this object but suggested the Rosenwalds might have acquired it on their round-the-world trip in 1958 (conversation with Alison Luchs, NGA curator, 26 August 1983). Their account of that trip (Edith and Lessing Rosenwald, _Writing Paper Back_, [privately printed, 1958]) includes no visit to Africa or mention of the relief, although the book rarely discusses purchases. Elizabeth Mongan, an earlier Rosenwald curator, had never seen the relief and suggested that it must have been acquired after she left the position in 1962 (telephone conversation, 13 March 1985).",Rosenwald Collection,Sculpture,,0.0,,,1.0,8324.0,11654.0,,47212.0,,2100.0,1.0,,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian,anonymous,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/18cee2f1-0a8b-4443-a387-f05324497f8b/full/full/0/default.jpg,9.756763876557424e-06,Ethiopia,ET,Africa

[1] The Duveen Brothers Records document the firm’s sixteen year pursuit and eventual acquisition of the Dreyfus collection, which included paintings, sculptures, small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes. Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929. Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.

[1] Ruth Fine, former Rosenwald curator, found no record of purchase for this object but suggested the Rosenwalds might have acquired it on their round-the-world trip in 1958 (conversation with Alison Luchs, NGA curator, 26 August 1983). Their account of that trip (Edith and Lessing Rosenwald, _Writing Paper Back_, [privately printed, 1958]) includes no visit to Africa or mention of the relief, although the book rarely discusses purchases. Elizabeth Mongan, an earlier Rosenwald curator, had never seen the relief and suggested that it must have been acquired after she left the position in 1962 (telephone conversation, 13 March 1985).",Rosenwald Collection,Sculpture,,0.0,,,0.0,8430.0,11802.0,,47212.0,,2100.0,1.0,,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian,anonymous,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/e23e5949-d3eb-4595-a954-d08821944d93/full/full/0/default.jpg,9.756763876557424e-06,Ethiopia,ET,Africa

[1] The painting is first recorded in the Earl of Pembroke's collection at Wilton by C. Gambarini, _A Description of the Earl of Pembroke's Pictures_, Westminster, 1731: 93, no. 4. Johann David Passavant, _Tour of a German Artist in England_, English ed., 2 vols, London, 1836: 1:306, connected it with the mention of a painting of Judith by Raphael in Abraham van der Doort's 1639 inventory of the collection of King Charles I (published as Abraham van der Doort, _A Catalogue and Description of King Charles the First's Capital Collection of Pictures, Limnings, Statues, Bronzes, Medals, and Other Curiosities_, London, 1757), which was said to have been obtained in exchange for two works that had belonged to the Third Earl of Pembroke:  a portrait of a young woman and a religious work by Parmigianino. The Raphael Judith is thus mentioned twice in connection with these two other works.

Children of Permencius had in way of Exchange for the little Judith of Rafell Urbin when you were Prince of the late decd Lo: of Penbrooke Steward of your Mats houshould: painted upon the right light."" The _Judith_ is mentioned again in item no. 26:  ""Item a peece of. 2. naked Children imbraceing one another signifying Christ and St John in-the desart said to bee don by Parmentius Chaunged by yor Maty with my Lo: Steward Pembrooke decd for a Judith beeing a little intire figure said to have been don by Raphael d'Urben..."" (quoted from Oliver Millar, ""Abraham van der Doort's Catalogue of the Collections of Charles I,"" _Walpole Society_ 37 (1960): 79, 81). But Millar 1960: 232, rejecting Passavant's identification, has suggested that the Judith in the inventory may be identifiable with Giorgione's well-known painting of the heroine in the State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg.



The painting's inclusion in a 1992 exhibition about Lorenzo de' Medici's Giardino di San Marco reflected its occasional identification with a small panel painting of Judith by Mantegna, listed in the 1492 inventory of Lorenzo's collection. This work was similar in scale and function to NGA 1942.9.42, that is, ""una tavoletta [small panel] in una cassetta [box] dipinti su una Giudetta chon la testa d'Oloferno e una serva, opera d'Andrea Squarcione [i.e., Mantegna]"" (_Libro d'inventario_ 1992: 51). Paul Kristeller, _Andrea Mantegna_, trans. S. Arthur Strong, London and New York, 1901: 20-21, who did not regard the NGA painting as Mantegna's, listed Lorenzo's little panel of the same subject among the artist's lost or missing works. Lionello Venturi (_Pitture italiane in America_, Milan, 1931, and expanded English ed., _Italian Paintings in America_, trans. Countess van den Heuvel and Charles Marriott, 3 vols., New York and Milan, 1933: 2: pl. 340, note) first identified the NGA painting with Lorenzo's picture, and Hans Tietze (_Meisterwerke europäischer Malerei in Amerika_, Vienna, 1935: 328, and English ed., 1939: 312) followed suit. Though accepted hypothetically by Renata Cipriani, _Tutta la pittura del Mantegna_, 1st and 2nd ed., Milan, 1956: 60, and English ed., _All the Paintings of Mantegna_, trans. Paul Colacicchi, 2 vols., New York, 1963: 79, and by Rona Goffen in _Small Paintings of the Masters, Masterpieces Reproduced in Actual Size. Early Italian School_, ed. Leslie Shore, 3 vols., Redding, Connecticut, 1980: no. 30, the identification was rejected by Erika Tietze-Conrat, _Mantegna.  Paintings Drawings Engravings_, New York, 1955: 245; Niny Garavaglia, _L'opera completa del Mantegna_, Milan, 1967: 109-110; and Ronald Lightbown, _Mantegna_, Oxford, 1986: 435, cat. 30.



[2] The Getty Provenance Index provides the details about the listing in Agnew's stock. The entry for the painting in the Duveen Brothers Records has the following notations: ""1/2 share Scott Fowles,"" ""Sotheby 19/7/17,"" and ""Agnew 23/9/17"" (copy in NGA curatorial files; X Book, Reel 422, Duveen Brothers Records, accession number 960015, Research Library, The Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles). According to Edward Fowles (_Memories of Duveen Brothers_, London, 1976: 127-129), a large collection of Italian paintings was offered on approval to Hamilton by 1920, but he did not purchase them and returned them to Duveen the following year.



[3] Widener collection records, in NGA curatorial files, give a purchase date of c. 1921, but the Duveen Brothers Records list expenses for the painting into 1923, indicating they probably still had ownership until that time.







",Widener Collection,Painting,,0.0,,,0.0,2947.0,4924.0,,1181.0,"Standing at the entrance of an open tent, a woman holds the severed head of a bearded man over a sack held open by another person in this vertical painting. All the people have pale, ivory-white skin. To our right, Judith, who holds the head, stands with her body angled to our left. She looks back over her shoulder, off to our right, with light brown eyes. She has a long nose, smooth cheeks, and her small, apricot-peach tinged lips are closed. Tightly curled, amber-brown ringlets frame her oval face and fall to her shoulders. Her loose, pearl-white dress, which is almost the color of her skin, falls off one shoulder and is belted just below her bust. A long, ultramarine-blue cloth drapes over one shoulder and arm, and around her body. Open-toed, moss-green sandals peek out from beneath her hem. Her right hand, to our left, grasps a long, straight, iron blade by her hip. The blade has a ridge up along its center and the tip is cut straight across. She holds up the severed head in her other hand, so that arm crosses her body. The severed head faces away from us so only a sliver of the nose, cheek, and one closed eye are visible. The head has chestnut-brown hair and beard, and the mouth is open wide. To our left, the attendant holding the sack looks down at the head, her face framed by a white cloth that wraps around her head, under her chin, and across her shoulders. She wears a canary-yellow tunic over silvery-gray pants. A red cape drapes over one shoulder and around her body. She is barefoot. The tent is supported by a wooden pole, just beyond and between the pair. The gold-edged, rose-pink flaps of the tent have been pulled back and tied to each side. The interior beyond them is dark but the end of a gold bed draped with white cloth and one bare foot, the sole coming toward us, emerges from the shadows, to our right of Judith. The ground beneath the tent is made of tan, roughly square stones, scattered with pebbles. The peak of the tent rises off the top center of the composition, and the area to each side is midnight blue.",1507.0,1.0,500004218.0,"Mantegna, Andrea",Andrea Mantegna,Mantegna,Italian,individual,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/c6e0cea2-9175-4f75-9dd7-024d479d4478/full/full/0/default.jpg,0.045246992477535,Italy,IT,Europe

Rosenwald; [1] gift 1950/1951 to the National Gallery of Art. 

[1] In _Recollections of a Collector_, 1976, p. 56-57, Rosenwald described being approached by a young man in South America who offered to sell his father’s collection of prints that he had brought with him from Germany. Rosenwald gives the year as 1951, but his appointment books confirm that it was actually 1950 - he left for Buenos Aires on 9 February 1950 and returned on 20 March 1950 (Library of Congress, Rosenwald Papers, Box 75). Rosenwald writes that he bought the entire collection of some 1100 prints and drawings, but as they had already been scheduled to be sent to Europe they came to the United States via Antwerp, arriving in the US in late April 1950. Rosenwald decided to keep about a quarter of the collection, destined for the National Gallery of Art, and donate the remainder to other institutions. The inventory log of Alverthorpe indicates that just over 300 works were accessioned there in May of 1950, inventory numbers 50.260-50.530, acquired from Claude Schaefer (Gallery Archives, National Gallery of Art, RG 45A1, Rosenwald Papers, Box 41).",Rosenwald Collection,Print,,0.0,,,0.0,3069.0,4000.0,640.0,40215.0,,3124.0,1.0,500018899.0,"Steinhardt, Jakob",Jakob Steinhardt,Steinhardt,Israeli,individual,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/6a5a5285-2ee7-4cf8-8593-a3a2985ca87d/full/full/0/default.jpg,0.0003951489370005,Israel,IL,Asia

[1] Ruth Fine, former Rosenwald curator, found no record of purchase for this object but suggested the Rosenwalds might have acquired it on their round-the-world trip in 1958 (conversation with Alison Luchs, NGA curator, 26 August 1983). Their account of that trip (Edith and Lessing Rosenwald, _Writing Paper Back_, [privately printed, 1958]) includes no visit to Africa or mention of the relief, although the book rarely discusses purchases. Elizabeth Mongan, an earlier Rosenwald curator, had never seen the relief and suggested that it must have been acquired after she left the position in 1962 (telephone conversation, 13 March 1985).",Rosenwald Collection,Sculpture,,0.0,,,1.0,8324.0,11654.0,,47212.0,,2100.0,1.0,,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian,anonymous,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/18cee2f1-0a8b-4443-a387-f05324497f8b/full/full/0/default.jpg,9.756763876557424e-06,Ethiopia,ET,Africa

[1] The early provenance cited here is an update to the provenance published in the NGA systematic catalogue entry (Little et al. 1998, 237-238).  The published provenance, indicating a purchase by P.A.B. Widener from Duveen in 1915 or 1922 was based on confusion resulting from the Lynnewood Hall inventory sheet for 1942.9.638 and 1942.9.639, annotated with notes by Widener curator Edith Standen, having originally been cut in half and each half filed separately in its object folder.  Miss Standen's notes on the full sheet do clarify that the two vases were bought separately, as indicated in this revised provenance.  The Morgan Collection is also noted on the Widener Collection card for this vase.",Widener Collection,Decorative Art,,0.0,,,0.0,721.0,1200.0,,1816.0,,8362.0,1.0,500373095.0,Chinese Qing Dynasty,Chinese Qing Dynasty,Chinese Qing Dynasty,Chinese,anonymous,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/0fc6b7c8-aaf9-43fc-9e96-fc4b43d38829/full/full/0/default.jpg,0.0019074473378669,China,CN,Asia

[1] Ruth Fine, former Rosenwald curator, found no record of purchase for this object but suggested the Rosenwalds might have acquired it on their round-the-world trip in 1958 (conversation with Alison Luchs, NGA curator, 26 August 1983). Their account of that trip (Edith and Lessing Rosenwald, _Writing Paper Back_, [privately printed, 1958]) includes no visit to Africa or mention of the relief, although the book rarely discusses purchases. Elizabeth Mongan, an earlier Rosenwald curator, had never seen the relief and suggested that it must have been acquired after she left the position in 1962 (telephone conversation, 13 March 1985).",Rosenwald Collection,Sculpture,,0.0,,,1.0,8324.0,11654.0,,47212.0,,2100.0,1.0,,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian,anonymous,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/18cee2f1-0a8b-4443-a387-f05324497f8b/full/full/0/default.jpg,9.756763876557424e-06,Ethiopia,ET,Africa

Knoedler & Company, Inc., New York); purchased May 1956 by Paul Mellon, Upperville, Virginia; gift 1985 to NGA.

[1] The artist's heirs were René De Gas, his last surviving brother, who lived in Paris, and the four (of seven) surviving children of his sister Marguerite, who had died in Argentina in 1895.  (His other deceased sister Thérèse left no descendants.) Marguerite's children were: Jeanne Fevre, unmarried and acting on both her own behalf and as the representative of her sister, Madeleine Marie Pauline Fevre, a Carmelite nun; Henri Jean Auguste Marie Fevre, an industrialist who lived in Marseille; and Gabriel Edgar Eugène Fevre, an agent in Montevideo, Uruguay.  See Anne Pingeot and Frank Horvat, _Degas sculptures_, Paris, 1991, and Anne Pingeot, ""The casting of Degas' sculptures: Completing the story,"" _Apollo_ (August 1995): 60-63.



[2] On 13 May 1918 a contract was signed between the artist's heirs and the Hébrard foundry authorizing the reproduction of Degas' sculptures in bronze.  Of the approximately 150 statuettes found in the artist's studio after his death, 74 figures were ultimately cast in bronze.  The contract stipulated that two complete sets were to be cast, one for the heirs and one for the foundry, and authorized a limit of twenty casts of each figure to be offered for sale.  The casting process took at least thirteen years, from 1919 to 1932, and according to the contract, the original figures became the property of the foundry.  See Sara Campbell, ""Degas' bronzes: Introduction,"" _Apollo_ (August 1995): 6-10.



[3] The article by Anne Pingeot referenced in note 1 provides details of the role of Hébrard's daughter in the history of the foundry, and its work in casting the bronzes.

Klejman Gallery, New York); purchased around 30 November 1955 by Winston Guest, New York; gift 1955 to NGA.

[1] The sculpture cannot be precisely dated but is thought to have been made during the eighteenth century. It would have belonged to the ruling Oba, and then passed by descent to succeeding Obas. 

[2] According to the Sotheby’s, London, sales catalog of 5-6 July 1954, the object was “acquired by the present owner following on the Benin punitive expedition of 1897.”

[3] Cowan was a merchant from Liverpool who spent his career working for trading firms based in Nigeria. Although not known to have been a member of the British Punitive Expedition of 1897, he was possibly in Nigeria in 1897 (or shortly after) and may have come into possession of the object around that time through a member of the Expedition.

[1] The Duveen Brothers Records document the firm’s sixteen year pursuit and eventual acquisition of the Dreyfus collection, which included paintings, sculptures, small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes. Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929. Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.

[1] The discovery of the series of Tasso paintings, of which this and NGA 1964.21.1 are part, is variously recounted in the early literature (see references). Only Antonio Morassi, ""Aggiunta al Guardi: le cinque 'Storie' della Gerusalemme liberata"", _Emporium_ 131 (1960): 247; Fern Rusk Shapley, _Catalogue of Italian Paintings_, 2 vols., Washington, D.C., 1979: 1:232; and a few contemporary news accounts, for example, _Giornale del Mattino_ 30 October 1959, mention the ""Dublin dealer."" The rest report that Carritt discovered them in ""the shed of an old house in Ireland.""

There is no evidence which of the Bantry residences originally housed the paintings, or when and where they were acquired. An unsubstantiated, and unlikely, rumor that the paintings were once at Versailles is variously reported in the NGA curatorial files. Francis J.B. Watson, ""Guardi and England"", in _Problemi Guardeschi. Atti del convegno di studi promossi della Mostra dei Guardi. 13-14 settembre 1965_, Venice, 1967:  212, speculated that the earl of Bantry may have acquired the paintings as works by François Boucher (1703-1770).

[1] Peter Barlow, a New York jurist and magistrate, was a collateral descendant of the sitter, and in 1914 donated to several American museums plaster casts of the Houdon marble bust of his ancestor (see documentation in NGA curatorial files).

An article in _The New York Times_ of 7 April 1912, ""Magistrate Barlow Finds Bust of Ancestor,"" recounts the history of the marble bust from which the casts were made. Peter Barlow told newspaper that the bust was on exhibition in the Paris Salon in 1804, and that the sitter, Joel Barlow (1754-1812), an American diplomat, probably brought it to the United States in 1805 when he returned to the U.S. and took up residence in Washington, D.C. Several years after his death, Joel Barlow's immediate descendants took the bust with them when they moved to far western Pennsylvania. The last owner of the bust was H.P.

Rosenwald; [1] gift 1950/1951 to the National Gallery of Art. 

[1] In _Recollections of a Collector_, 1976, p. 56-57, Rosenwald described being approached by a young man in South America who offered to sell his father’s collection of prints that he had brought with him from Germany. Rosenwald gives the year as 1951, but his appointment books confirm that it was actually 1950 - he left for Buenos Aires on 9 February 1950 and returned on 20 March 1950 (Library of Congress, Rosenwald Papers, Box 75). Rosenwald writes that he bought the entire collection of some 1100 prints and drawings, but as they had already been scheduled to be sent to Europe they came to the United States via Antwerp, arriving in the US in late April 1950. Rosenwald decided to keep about a quarter of the collection, destined for the National Gallery of Art, and donate the remainder to other institutions. The inventory log of Alverthorpe indicates that just over 300 works were accessioned there in May of 1950, inventory numbers 50.260-50.530, acquired from Claude Schaefer (Gallery Archives, National Gallery of Art, RG 45A1, Rosenwald Papers, Box 41).",Rosenwald Collection,Drawing,,0.0,,,0.0,4000.0,3468.0,,40072.0,,2718.0,1.0,500325128.0,"Rosenwald, Lessing Julius",Lessing Julius Rosenwald,Rosenwald,American,individual,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/767e2f04-7d33-4cfb-91f7-0d0527be3297/full/full/0/default.jpg,0.709936288331886,United States,US,North America

Kress Foundation, New York;[1] gift 1957 to NGA.


[1] The Duveen Brothers Records document the firm’s sixteen year pursuit and eventual acquisition of the Dreyfus collection, which included paintings, sculptures, small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes. Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929. Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.

Klejman Gallery, New York); purchased around 30 November 1955 by Winston Guest, New York; gift 1955 to NGA.

[1] The sculpture cannot be precisely dated but is thought to have been made during the eighteenth century. It would have belonged to the ruling Oba, and then passed by descent to succeeding Obas. 

[2] According to the Sotheby’s, London, sales catalog of 5-6 July 1954, the object was “acquired by the present owner following on the Benin punitive expedition of 1897.”

[3] Cowan was a merchant from Liverpool who spent his career working for trading firms based in Nigeria. Although not known to have been a member of the British Punitive Expedition of 1897, he was possibly in Nigeria in 1897 (or shortly after) and may have come into possession of the object around that time through a member of the Expedition.

[1] In _Recollections of a Collector_, 1976, p. 56-57, Rosenwald described being approached by a young man in South America who offered to sell his father’s collection of prints that he had brought with him from Germany. Rosenwald gives the year as 1951, but his appointment books confirm that it was actually 1950 - he left for Buenos Aires on 9 February 1950 and returned on 20 March 1950 (Library of Congress, Rosenwald Papers, Box 75). Rosenwald writes that he bought the entire collection of some 1100 prints and drawings, but as they had already been scheduled to be sent to Europe they came to the United States via Antwerp, arriving in the US in late April 1950. Rosenwald decided to keep about a quarter of the collection, destined for the National Gallery of Art, and donate the remainder to other institutions. The inventory log of Alverthorpe indicates that just over 300 works were accessioned there in May of 1950, inventory numbers 50.260-50.530, acquired from Claude Schaefer (Gallery Archives, National Gallery of Art, RG 45A1, Rosenwald Papers, Box 41).",Rosenwald Collection,Print,39961.0,0.0,Trabrennen,Trabrennen [1951.10.168-180],0.0,4000.0,3228.0,640.0,39973.0,,2718.0,1.0,500325128.0,"Rosenwald, Lessing Julius",Lessing Julius Rosenwald,Rosenwald,American,individual,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/587a8f3e-86c0-433d-ab4c-500050e40f7e/full/full/0/default.jpg,0.709936288331886,United States,US,North America

Klejman Gallery, New York); purchased around 30 November 1955 by Winston Guest, New York; gift 1955 to NGA.

[1] The sculpture cannot be precisely dated but is thought to have been made during the eighteenth century. It would have belonged to the ruling Oba, and then passed by descent to succeeding Obas. 

[2] According to the Sotheby’s, London, sales catalog of 5-6 July 1954, the object was “acquired by the present owner following on the Benin punitive expedition of 1897.”

[3] Cowan was a merchant from Liverpool who spent his career working for trading firms based in Nigeria. Although not known to have been a member of the British Punitive Expedition of 1897, he was possibly in Nigeria in 1897 (or shortly after) and may have come into possession of the object around that time through a member of the Expedition.

One vase acquired by Thomas B. Clarke [1848-1931], New York; sold 1913 to Peter A. B. Widener.  The other vase acquired by J. Pierpont Morgan [1837-1913], New York, by 1911; sold to (Duveen Brothers, New York and London); sold 1915 to Peter A. B. Widener, Lynnewood Hall, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania; both vases inheritance from Estate of Peter A. B. Widener by gift through power of appointment of Joseph E. Widener, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania;[1] gift 1942 to NGA.

[1] The NGA curatorial records discuss 1942.9.485 and 1942.9.486 together, and note that one was acquired from Clarke, who reportedly obtained it from ""Yan-li San, China, treasurer of Chinese empire,"" while the other was acquired from Duveen, who had obtained it from Morgan.  In _Catalogue of the Morgan Collection of Chinese Porcelains; privately printed by order of Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan_, 2 vols., New York, 1904-1911: 2:82, no. 1340, this piece is said to have come from the imperial collection.  The records, however, do not make clear which vase is which.  A letter dated 1 November 1934 from Duveen Brothers concerning the Morgan piece (in NGA curatorial files), states that Yan Li San might have been a member of the imperial family, noting that Clarke, who worked on the second volume of the Morgan collection, in which this vessel is catalogued, ""may have had means of identifying Yan Li San as a member of the imperial family, but omitted to mention the name in the catalogue.""  This suggests that Duveen Brothers had the impression that both vases had their origin in the same figure, a member of the imperial family.  However, a plausible candiate as the former owner of at least one, if not both, of these vases is the high official of Mongol background, Yang Lishan (c. 1900), who served in the Imperial Household Department (Neiwu Fu).  This might account for imperial associations surrounding the Morgan vase if indeed its origin was also with him.  Eventually Yang became a president of the Board of Revenue (Hubu Shangshu), which could have been interpreted as ""treasurer of the Chinese empire.""  His biography is in Erxun Zhao, et al., _Qing Shigao [Draft Standard History of Qing]_, Taipei, 1981: 18 juan 466, p. 12,763.  Yang was known for what were thought to be proforeign views, and was executed 11 August 1900 after protesting against the encouragement of the antiforeign Boxers.  Only a few days later the Allied Expeditionary Forces entered Beijing.  Perhaps these vases were among the booty reportedly taken from Yang's house by the French missionary Bishop Alphonse Favier (1837-1905), according to The Compilation Group, _History of Modern China: The Yi Ho Tuan Movement of 1900_, Beijing, 1976: 93, and then dispersed, eventually reaching Thomas B. Clarke in the United States along with the somewhat garbled name and occupation of their original owner.  Besides being a collector, Clarke imported and sold Chinese porcelains, and was familiar with Père Favier's collection, as shown in a note in Thomas B. Clarke and George B. Warren, _Catalogue of Antique Chinese Porcelains: Owned by George Warren of Troy, New York, with a note of introduction by Thomas B.

[1] The sculpture cannot be precisely dated but is thought to have been made during the eighteenth century. It would have belonged to the ruling Oba, and then passed by descent to succeeding Obas. 

[2] According to the Sotheby’s, London, sales catalog of 5-6 July 1954, the object was “acquired by the present owner following on the Benin punitive expedition of 1897.”

[3] Cowan was a merchant from Liverpool who spent his career working for trading firms based in Nigeria. Although not known to have been a member of the British Punitive Expedition of 1897, he was possibly in Nigeria in 1897 (or shortly after) and may have come into possession of the object around that time through a member of the Expedition.

[1] The Duveen Brothers Records document the firm’s sixteen year pursuit and eventual acquisition of the Dreyfus collection, which included paintings, sculptures, small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes. Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929. Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.

Petiet, Paris); sold May 1954 to Lessing Julius Rosenwald, Jenkintown, Pennsylvania;[2] gift 1954 to NGA.

[1] In 1952 Maurice Gobin first introduced and discussed a group of terracotta figurines; see Maurice Gobin, _Daumier Sculpteur. 1808-1879_, Geneva, 1952.  They were cast in bronze, and Lessing Rosenwald acquired ten different bronzes from the group.  Correspondence in the Rosenwald Papers, NGA Archives, suggests that the casting project was initiated and supervised by Gobin himself simultaneously with the publication of his book, and that he also seems to have masterminded their distribution and price.  For Gobin's role, see Henri M. Petiet, letters of 27 April 1956, 16 July and 11 December 1957, to Elizabeth Mongan; and Mongan, letter of 20 December 1957, to Petiet (Rosenwald Papers, NGA Archives, Box 69 [1956], and Box 74 [1957].



[2] The dealer Henri Petiet received the bronzes as soon as they were serialized, which was in pairs, and offered most of them to Mr. Rosenwald, allegedly as they were released to the public.  The second pair (NGA 1954.13.2 and .3) were serialized and released around January 1954, and purchased May 1954.  NGA 1954.13.2 was apparently not obtained by Petiet from Gobin directly.  See Petiet, letter of 7 January 1954, to Mr. Rosenwald, and a list titled ""Alverthorpe--Daumier. Bronzes purchased"" [from H.M.  Petiet, Paris], dated June 1959; Rosenwald Papers, NGA Archives, Box 61 [1954], Box 82 [list].",Rosenwald Collection,Sculpture,,0.0,,,1.0,6616.0,8270.0,,43200.0,,1209.0,2.0,500117998.0,"Daumier, Honoré",Honoré Daumier,Daumier,French,individual,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/8884bb93-5587-451e-a641-39e464e49bdf/full/full/0/default.jpg,0.1018996419267657,France,FR,Europe

[2] Acquired by Alexander A. Cowan [1867-1955], England/Nigeria, in or after 1897; [3] (sale, Sotheby’s, London, 5-6 July 1954, no. 82). (J.J. Klejman Gallery, New York); purchased around 30 November 1955 by Winston Guest, New York; gift 1955 to NGA.

[1] The sculpture cannot be precisely dated but is thought to have been made during the eighteenth century. It would have belonged to the ruling Oba, and then passed by descent to succeeding Obas. 

[2] According to the Sotheby’s, London, sales catalog of 5-6 July 1954, the object was “acquired by the present owner following on the Benin punitive expedition of 1897.”

[3] Cowan was a merchant from Liverpool who spent his career working for trading firms based in Nigeria. Although not known to have been a member of the British Punitive Expedition of 1897, he was possibly in Nigeria in 1897 (or shortly after) and may have come into possession of the object around that time through a member of the Expedition.

Klejman Gallery, New York); purchased around 30 November 1955 by Winston Guest, New York; gift 1955 to NGA.

[1] The sculpture cannot be precisely dated but is thought to have been made during the eighteenth century. It would have belonged to the ruling Oba, and then passed by descent to succeeding Obas. 

[2] According to the Sotheby’s, London, sales catalog of 5-6 July 1954, the object was “acquired by the present owner following on the Benin punitive expedition of 1897.”

[3] Cowan was a merchant from Liverpool who spent his career working for trading firms based in Nigeria. Although not known to have been a member of the British Punitive Expedition of 1897, he was possibly in Nigeria in 1897 (or shortly after) and may have come into possession of the object around that time through a member of the Expedition.

[1] Unfortunately, Clarke provided no descriptive information about Ta-kee as he had about Yan Li San (see the provenance for NGA 1942.9.485 and 1942.9.486), so it is difficult to speculate about his identity; the source for this information is the Widener collection records kept by Edith Standen (now in the NGA curatorial files).",Widener Collection,Decorative Art,,0.0,,,0.0,1446.0,1200.0,,1724.0,,8362.0,1.0,500373095.0,Chinese Qing Dynasty,Chinese Qing Dynasty,Chinese Qing Dynasty,Chinese,anonymous,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/1de9466b-2b81-4879-8e53-2eb5fa19f154/full/full/0/default.jpg,0.0019074473378669,China,CN,Asia

Klejman Gallery, New York); purchased around 30 November 1955 by Winston Guest, New York; gift 1955 to NGA.

[1] The sculpture cannot be precisely dated but is thought to have been made during the eighteenth century. It would have belonged to the ruling Oba, and then passed by descent to succeeding Obas. 

[2] According to the Sotheby’s, London, sales catalog of 5-6 July 1954, the object was “acquired by the present owner following on the Benin punitive expedition of 1897.”

[3] Cowan was a merchant from Liverpool who spent his career working for trading firms based in Nigeria. Although not known to have been a member of the British Punitive Expedition of 1897, he was possibly in Nigeria in 1897 (or shortly after) and may have come into possession of the object around that time through a member of the Expedition.

Blended brushstrokes give the painting a soft, almost blurred look. She stands with her body angled slightly to our left and her head tipped forward under her hands, which work in her hair. Her cheeks are flushed and her wide, pink lips are closed. Her round breasts are firm, and a piece of bright white fabric is bunched around her upper thighs below a smooth pubic area. Garments in the pile of fabric behind her are petal pink, vivid white, ruby red, and buttercup yellow. The area behind and around the woman and fabric is loosely painted with sage green, caramel brown, and golden yellow. Touches of yellow on a field of green to our right suggest grass and flowers.

[1] The Duveen Brothers Records document the firm’s sixteen year pursuit and eventual acquisition of the Dreyfus collection, which included paintings, sculptures, small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes. Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929. Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.

One vase acquired by Thomas B. Clarke [1848-1931], New York; sold 1913 to Peter A. B. Widener.  The other vase acquired by J. Pierpont Morgan [1837-1913], New York, by 1911; sold to (Duveen Brothers, New York and London); sold 1915 to Peter A. B. Widener, Lynnewood Hall, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania; both vases inheritance from Estate of Peter A. B. Widener by gift through power of appointment of Joseph E. Widener, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania;[1] gift 1942 to NGA.

[1] The NGA curatorial records discuss 1942.9.485 and 1942.9.486 together, and note that one was acquired from Clarke, who reportedly obtained it from ""Yan-li San, China, treasurer of Chinese empire,"" while the other was acquired from Duveen, who had obtained it from Morgan.  In _Catalogue of the Morgan Collection of Chinese Porcelains; privately printed by order of Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan_, 2 vols., New York, 1904-1911: 2:82, no. 1340, this piece is said to have come from the imperial collection.  The records, however, do not make clear which vase is which.  A letter dated 1 November 1934 from Duveen Brothers concerning the Morgan piece (in NGA curatorial files), states that Yan Li San might have been a member of the imperial family, noting that Clarke, who worked on the second volume of the Morgan collection, in which this vessel is catalogued, ""may have had means of identifying Yan Li San as a member of the imperial family, but omitted to mention the name in the catalogue.""  This suggests that Duveen Brothers had the impression that both vases had their origin in the same figure, a member of the imperial family.  However, a plausible candiate as the former owner of at least one, if not both, of these vases is the high official of Mongol background, Yang Lishan (c. 1900), who served in the Imperial Household Department (Neiwu Fu).  This might account for imperial associations surrounding the Morgan vase if indeed its origin was also with him.  Eventually Yang became a president of the Board of Revenue (Hubu Shangshu), which could have been interpreted as ""treasurer of the Chinese empire.""  His biography is in Erxun Zhao, et al., _Qing Shigao [Draft Standard History of Qing]_, Taipei, 1981: 18 juan 466, p. 12,763.  Yang was known for what were thought to be proforeign views, and was executed 11 August 1900 after protesting against the encouragement of the antiforeign Boxers.  Only a few days later the Allied Expeditionary Forces entered Beijing.  Perhaps these vases were among the booty reportedly taken from Yang's house by the French missionary Bishop Alphonse Favier (1837-1905), according to The Compilation Group, _History of Modern China: The Yi Ho Tuan Movement of 1900_, Beijing, 1976: 93, and then dispersed, eventually reaching Thomas B. Clarke in the United States along with the somewhat garbled name and occupation of their original owner.  Besides being a collector, Clarke imported and sold Chinese porcelains, and was familiar with Père Favier's collection, as shown in a note in Thomas B. Clarke and George B. Warren, _Catalogue of Antique Chinese Porcelains: Owned by George Warren of Troy, New York, with a note of introduction by Thomas B.

[1] The sculpture cannot be precisely dated but is thought to have been made during the eighteenth century. It would have belonged to the ruling Oba, and then passed by descent to succeeding Obas. 

[2] According to the Sotheby’s, London, sales catalog of 5-6 July 1954, the object was “acquired by the present owner following on the Benin punitive expedition of 1897.”

[3] Cowan was a merchant from Liverpool who spent his career working for trading firms based in Nigeria. Although not known to have been a member of the British Punitive Expedition of 1897, he was possibly in Nigeria in 1897 (or shortly after) and may have come into possession of the object around that time through a member of the Expedition.

Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929. Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.

[1] In _Recollections of a Collector_, 1976, p. 56-57, Rosenwald described being approached by a young man in South America who offered to sell his father’s collection of prints that he had brought with him from Germany. Rosenwald gives the year as 1951, but his appointment books confirm that it was actually 1950 - he left for Buenos Aires on 9 February 1950 and returned on 20 March 1950 (Library of Congress, Rosenwald Papers, Box 75). Rosenwald writes that he bought the entire collection of some 1100 prints and drawings, but as they had already been scheduled to be sent to Europe they came to the United States via Antwerp, arriving in the US in late April 1950. Rosenwald decided to keep about a quarter of the collection, destined for the National Gallery of Art, and donate the remainder to other institutions. The inventory log of Alverthorpe indicates that just over 300 works were accessioned there in May of 1950, inventory numbers 50.260-50.530, acquired from Claude Schaefer (Gallery Archives, National Gallery of Art, RG 45A1, Rosenwald Papers, Box 41).",Rosenwald Collection,Print,,0.0,,,0.0,2934.0,3739.0,640.0,40216.0,,3124.0,1.0,500018899.0,"Steinhardt, Jakob",Jakob Steinhardt,Steinhardt,Israeli,individual,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/0e73ed7a-eb08-4603-b1ef-3de3d5c9e6e4/full/full/0/default.jpg,0.0003951489370005,Israel,IL,Asia

[1] John Rewald, ""Theo Van Gogh, Goupil, and the Impressionists"", _Gazette des Beaux Arts_, 6th per., 81 (January-February 1973): 72. Claire Frèches-Thory in _The Art of Paul Gauguin_, Exh. cat., National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.; Art Institute of Chicago; Galeries Nationales du Grand Palais, Paris; Washington, D.C., 1988: 183, claims Schuffenecker owned _Eve_, presumably on the basis of the 1891 Brussels exhibition catalogue in which his is the only lenders' name cited for Gauguin's entries there.  However, his name appears below the last three entries, ""4. trois vases (poterie),"" as if these alone were his.  That conclusion is supported by a letter from Schuffenecker to Octave Maus, the organizer of the _Vingtiste_ exhibition, cited in Rewald 1973: 68, n. 140, that reportedly claims he merely lent three ceramic pieces to the show--hence the three ""pottery"" vases.



[2] This possibility was suggested by Victor Merlhès (personal communication) based on Gauguin's letter of early 1894, to be published in a forthcoming volume of the correspondence, that refers to _La Femme Noire_ in Gauguin's exhibition of 1893 at Durand-Ruel as belonging to Manzi.  Merlhès' proposal challenges the current identification of this work as _Black Venus_ (Nassau County Museum of Art, Roslyn Harbor, New York).



[3] Sales catalogue, Galerie Manzi, Joyant & Cie., Paris, 14 March 1919, no. 239, repro. opp. p. 40. The piece reportedly sold for 1,980 francs. See the biography of Michel Manzi in the preface (pp. I-XII).

Klejman Gallery, New York); purchased around 30 November 1955 by Winston Guest, New York; gift 1955 to NGA.

[1] The sculpture cannot be precisely dated but is thought to have been made during the eighteenth century. It would have belonged to the ruling Oba, and then passed by descent to succeeding Obas. 

[2] According to the Sotheby’s, London, sales catalog of 5-6 July 1954, the object was “acquired by the present owner following on the Benin punitive expedition of 1897.”

[3] Cowan was a merchant from Liverpool who spent his career working for trading firms based in Nigeria. Although not known to have been a member of the British Punitive Expedition of 1897, he was possibly in Nigeria in 1897 (or shortly after) and may have come into possession of the object around that time through a member of the Expedition.

[1] The sculpture cannot be precisely dated but is thought to have been made during the eighteenth century. It would have belonged to the ruling Oba, and then passed by descent to succeeding Obas. 

[2] According to the Sotheby’s, London, sales catalog of 5-6 July 1954, the object was “acquired by the present owner following on the Benin punitive expedition of 1897.”

[3] Cowan was a merchant from Liverpool who spent his career working for trading firms based in Nigeria. Although not known to have been a member of the British Punitive Expedition of 1897, he was possibly in Nigeria in 1897 (or shortly after) and may have come into possession of the object around that time through a member of the Expedition.

[1] In _Recollections of a Collector_, 1976, p. 56-57, Rosenwald described being approached by a young man in South America who offered to sell his father’s collection of prints that he had brought with him from Germany. Rosenwald gives the year as 1951, but his appointment books confirm that it was actually 1950 - he left for Buenos Aires on 9 February 1950 and returned on 20 March 1950 (Library of Congress, Rosenwald Papers, Box 75). Rosenwald writes that he bought the entire collection of some 1100 prints and drawings, but as they had already been scheduled to be sent to Europe they came to the United States via Antwerp, arriving in the US in late April 1950. Rosenwald decided to keep about a quarter of the collection, destined for the National Gallery of Art, and donate the remainder to other institutions. The inventory log of Alverthorpe indicates that just over 300 works were accessioned there in May of 1950, inventory numbers 50.260-50.530, acquired from Claude Schaefer (Gallery Archives, National Gallery of Art, RG 45A1, Rosenwald Papers, Box 41).",Rosenwald Collection,Drawing,,0.0,,,0.0,7105.0,10109.0,640.0,39561.0,,2547.0,1.0,500086297.0,"Mueller, Otto",Otto Mueller,Mueller,German,individual,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/5e92a7c5-fa1f-4197-9732-0e7a2d903a77/full/full/0/default.jpg,0.0407637594762569,Germany,DE,Europe

[1] This early provenance information was cited in the 1914 auction catalogue for the Griscom Collection.

There is no size information in the sale catalogue, and the description is very brief, so it is not certain this is the same painting.

[3] A note in NGA curatorial files indicates that Colnaghi purchased the painting that was no. 80 in the 1902 sale. This was kindly confirmed by Lynda McLeod, Librarian, Christie's Archives, London, who also provided the name of the consignor; see her e-mail of 28 March 2013, in NGA curatorial files.

[2] Acquired by Alexander A. Cowan [1867-1955], England/Nigeria, in or after 1897; [3] (sale, Sotheby’s, London, 5-6 July 1954, no. 82). (J.J. Klejman Gallery, New York); purchased around 30 November 1955 by Winston Guest, New York; gift 1955 to NGA.

[1] The sculpture cannot be precisely dated but is thought to have been made during the eighteenth century. It would have belonged to the ruling Oba, and then passed by descent to succeeding Obas. 

[2] According to the Sotheby’s, London, sales catalog of 5-6 July 1954, the object was “acquired by the present owner following on the Benin punitive expedition of 1897.”

[3] Cowan was a merchant from Liverpool who spent his career working for trading firms based in Nigeria. Although not known to have been a member of the British Punitive Expedition of 1897, he was possibly in Nigeria in 1897 (or shortly after) and may have come into possession of the object around that time through a member of the Expedition.

[1] The standard provenance that identifies Piétri of Papeete as the buyer from the 1903 death sale is based on Jean Loize, _Les Amitiés du peintre Georges-Daniel de Monfreid et ses reliques de Gauguin_, Paris, 1951, 133: ""Au dos [of Georges-Daniel Monfreid's notes about Gauguin's death], liste d'oeuvres de Gauguin achetées avant ou après sa mort...Les bois...'Thérèse et l'Evêque' aux mains de M. Piétri, Juge à Tahiti probablement....""  This is Monfreid's purely speculative statement, based on information that Loize believes comes from Victor Segalen.  The judge is a documented buyer of an inexpensive ""tiki"" (no. 64 at six francs; in Georges Wildenstein, ed., ""Vente des oeuvres d'art, livres et objets ayant appartenu à Gauguin. 2 septembre 1903"", _Gazette des Beaux Arts_, 6th per., 47, January-April 1956; published January 1958, 207).  However various other references suggest that the pendants went to Lévy, who bought three ""tikis"" from the sale (nos. 60-62 at 16, 15, and 20 francs (Wildenstein 1956, 207).  Segalen himself (_Lettres de Paul Gauguin à Georges-Daniel de Monfreid, précédées d'un hommage par Victor Segalen_, Paris and Zurich, 1918, 67-68) identified the pendants' buyer at the sale as a merchant (Lévy was a pearl merchant) and Henri Jacquier (""Histoire locale: Le dossier de la succession Paul Gauguin,"" _Bulletin de la Société des Etudes Océaniennes_, 120 [September 1957], 677) states that Lévy sold the pendants two years later to Edouard Druet.  Victor Merlhès (Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, Paris, correspondence with Anne Halpern dated 14 December 1999, in NGA curatorial files) suggested this alternative provenance and the texts that support it.  The Druet ownership is also based on a fragment of a paper label on the underside of the figure, on which is written, in ink, in block letters: [GALER] IE [D]RUET; in lower case: St-Honoré Par[is]/[Gaugui]n/[Paill]ard; and a printed number: 9 6 [996?].  The number could possibly be an inventory number.



[2] The provenance that places the work in the collections of Emile Schuffenecker and Ambroise Vollard is found in Christopher Gray, _Sculpture and Ceramics of Paul Gauguin _, Baltimore, 1963: 288.  A photograph in the Eitenne Bignou albums at the documentation center of the Musée d'Orsay is annotated with Vollard and Schuffenecker as former owners (copy NGA curatorial files). The Chester Dale papers (in NGA curatorial files) document only Vollard's ownership, and the provenance is recorded twice: ""Mr.  Bignou got it from Am. Vollard, who had it from Gauguin;"" and ""Former collection Ambrose[sic] Vollard, Paris, who bought it from Gauguin.""   Merlhès (as above, note 1) discounted their plausibility altogether.

[1] Deepdene was rented from Lord Francis Hope by Lilian Warren Price Hammersley [c. 1860/1865-1909], beginning in 1893 until her death there in 1909. She was the widow of the 8th duke of Marlborough, and later the wife of Lord William Beresford, and this fact accounts for the Duveen prospectus stating incorrectly that the sculpture was ""from the Collection of the late Duchess of Marlborough."" See letter of 7 February 1978, from Douglas Lewis, NGA curator of sculpture, to Miranda Strickland-Constable, curator at the Leeds City Art Gallery, England, in NGA curatorial files. The gallery in Leeds now owns the original sculpture by Canova from which Hope had the Corcoran/NGA copy made.

[2] The sculpture was stock number 33147 in the records of Duveen's London branch, and it was given this description in its first entry, for September 1912: ""1 life size white marble statue of Venus on pedestal. Signed A. Canova. from the Colln the late Duchess of Marlborough. Blenheim Palace."" The source was noted as ""C. Davis,"" who was the dealer Charles Davis (1849-1914), and the cost was 1200 pounds. The sculpture appears again in the next stock book, with nearly the identical description, listed under September-October 1912.

[1] Ruth Fine, former Rosenwald curator, found no record of purchase for this object but suggested the Rosenwalds might have acquired it on their round-the-world trip in 1958 (conversation with Alison Luchs, NGA curator, 26 August 1983). Their account of that trip (Edith and Lessing Rosenwald, _Writing Paper Back_, [privately printed, 1958]) includes no visit to Africa or mention of the relief, although the book rarely discusses purchases. Elizabeth Mongan, an earlier Rosenwald curator, had never seen the relief and suggested that it must have been acquired after she left the position in 1962 (telephone conversation, 13 March 1985).",Rosenwald Collection,Sculpture,,0.0,,,0.0,8430.0,11802.0,,47212.0,,2100.0,1.0,,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian,anonymous,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/e23e5949-d3eb-4595-a954-d08821944d93/full/full/0/default.jpg,9.756763876557424e-06,Ethiopia,ET,Africa

However, according to an undated memo by former NGA curator David Rust (copy in NGA curatorial files), the sculpture reproduced in the 1927 sale catalogue is not this work. After examining the reproduction of the only Modigliani head in the Drouot catalogue (no. 67, _Tête de femme_), Shelley Sturman, NGA head of object conservation, confirmed that it is not 1963.10.241, the head donated by Dale (see emails of 17 and 19 April, 2022, in NGA curatorial files).

Steinkopff's daughter (and only child) was married in 1899 to James Alexander Francis Humberston Stewart-Mackenzie, who was created the 1st baron Seaforth in 1921 and who died in 1923.

[2] A photograph in the archives of the Museo di Castello Sforzesco in Milan (no. 2430 D; a print is also preserved in the photographic collection of the Kunsthistorisches Institut in Florence) shows the NGA painting repainted, probably after suffering a radical cleaning most likely having occurred at the time of the change in ownership in the mid-1930s. The photograph probably dates before 28 April 1936, when the director of the museum in Milan, Giorgio Nicodemi, wrote a letter (in NGA curatorial files), documenting the fact that the painting, which he hoped would be donated to the Castello Sforzesco, had already been shown to him.  According to a note attached to the negative of the photograph in the photographic archive of the museum, the painting, owned by the family of the barons of Castelmuro, was at that time (1935) exhibited at the Museo Navale in Milan.  

[3] See Knoedler stock book no. 8, p. 156  and Knoedler sales book no. 13, p. 366,  M. Knoedler and Co. records, Getty Research Institute, Los Angeles (copies NGA curatorial files). According to a letter from R. Heinemann, Lugano, to C. Henschel of the firm M. Knoedler & Co., New York (copy in NGA curatorial files), the painting was shipped to New York on 29 April 1936.

[4] The date of purchase is given in the Mellon collection records, in NGA curatorial files.

All the people have pale skin, pink cheeks, blond hair, and flat, gold halos. The woman’s body is angled slightly to our right, and she holds her hands crossed over her chest as she gazes down at the baby. She has a straight, pointed nose and a small, pink-lipped mouth. Her azure-blue robe covers her head and drapes over much of the crimson-red dress beneath. The edge of the robe and cuff of her dress are trimmed in gold. The baby lies with his arms slightly raised and he looks up at the woman. His hips and legs are wrapped with sheer white cloth. The angels in the upper corners of the panel both wear robes in the same azure blue of the woman, and the garments have a gold band around the high waist and gold around the neckline.

[1] Unfortunately, we know nothing about the commission or the original location of the panel.  Based on a note affixed to the back of the picture, the painting is traditionally thought to have been in a church in Arnhem, in the Gelderland region of the Netherlands.  Colin Eisler's assertion that the painting may have been done for the high altar of the Sint Janskerk in Arnhem, is possible, but awaits confirming evidence. (Eisler 1977, 9, where he also suggests that the commission may have been given to Johan van Hatstein, Commander of the Order of Saint John from 1486 to 1497.)  The Sint Janskerk was demolished in 1817 and the first mention of the painting in connection with the ""cathédrale"" in Arnhem occurs in 1905: _Catalogue des Tableaux Anciens ... Provenant de la Collection de M. le Comte Jacques de Bryas_, Hôtel Drouot (Paris, 1905), 11, ""Cette oeuvre du plus grand caractère, et dans le plus admirable état de conservation, provient de la cathédrale d'Aarnheim, édifice gothique qui fut au XVIIe siècle désaffecté du culte catholique.""  Friedländer in the sales catalogue _Die Sammlung Richard von Kaufmann Berlin_, Paul Cassirer and Hugo Helbing (Berlin, 1917), no.  132, cites a ""Notiz auf der Rückseite"" as the basis for the Arnhem provenance.  This notice was never described and had disappeared by 1941, as per Karl vom Rath, _Der Meister des Bartholomäusaltares_.  (Bonn, 1941), 125, no. 9.

All the people have pale skin. At the center of the composition, the man in the water, Jesus, stands with his body angled slightly to our right. He is slim with shoulder-length, chestnut-brown hair, and he raises his hands to his chest, fingertips almost touching. To our right, the man who trickles water onto his head, John, faces our left in profile. Long, scraggly brown hair and beard frame his lined, wrinkled face, and he wears a camel-brown robe covering his torso and legs. It appears to be made from an animal skin whose face hangs at the bottom, draped over the edge of the riverbank. His bare arms reach forward toward Jesus as he upends a vessel in his right hand to pour out drops of water. The pair is flanked by three angels. The angel kneeling on the bank to our left has red hair and rust-red and teal-blue wings. That angel wears a scarlet-red cloak richly decorated with gold patterns and bordered with gemstones. With hands raised and fingertips touching, the angel holds a gray-green cloak hanging over a white robe. Two smaller angels kneel closer to us in front of the men. The red-headed angel on our left wears a powder-blue robe and strums a lute. The other, with blond hair and a white robe, draws a bow across a violin. A crowd of fifteen people float above and around Jesus, John, and the angels to create an arch over them. They are dressed in robes of crimson or rose red, violet purple, peacock blue, moss green, or beige, and some are dressed as clergy members. Each person holds an object, for example, a basket of wafers, a sword, or a bishop’s crook. A man on the right side wearing armor kneels on a dragon. An elderly bearded man wearing a crown sits at the top of the arch with his hands raised. Small angels on either side of him hold open his scarlet-red cloak, which is lined with peacock blue. A long, narrow scroll curls in the pale blue sky under him. It reads, “HIC EST EILIVS MEVS DILECTV IN QVO MICHI CONLICVI.” The landscape around Jesus, John, and the angels on the riverbank creates a low hill topped with bushy trees. A half moon of pale blue sky encloses the landscape, creating a dome shape across the center of the composition. The crowd of men and women seem to float between the sky and the shiny gold background that surrounds the people and whole scene.",1699.0,1.0,500017954.0,Master of the Saint Bartholomew Altar,Master of the Saint Bartholomew Altar,Master of the Saint Bartholomew Altar,German,individual,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/e09f2884-f3ed-4275-a572-ea5a35769030/full/full/0/default.jpg,0.0407637594762569,Germany,DE,Europe

1664.0,Bottle Vase,porcelain with pale blue glaze,overall: 15.3 x 7.5 cm (6 x 2 15/16 in.),in seal script on the base in underglaze blue in three vertical lines of two characters each: Da Qing Yongzheng nian zhi (made in the Yongzheng reign of the great Qing dynasty),,Chinese Qing Dynasty,Chinese Qing Dynasty,"Considered a pair with NGA 1942.9.485.  One vase acquired by Thomas B. Clarke [1848-1931], New York; sold 1913 to Peter A. B. Widener.  The other vase acquired by J. Pierpont Morgan [1837-1913], New York, by 1911; sold to (Duveen Brothers, New York and London); sold 1915 to Peter A. B. Widener, Lynnewood Hall, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania; both vases inheritance from Estate of Peter A. B. Widener by gift through power of appointment of Joseph E. Widener, Elkins Park, Pennsylvania;[1] gift 1942 to NGA.

[1] The NGA curatorial records discuss 1942.9.485 and 1942.9.486 together, and note that one was acquired from Clarke, who reportedly obtained it from ""Yan-li San, China, treasurer of Chinese empire,"" while the other was acquired from Duveen, who had obtained it from Morgan.  In _Catalogue of the Morgan Collection of Chinese Porcelains; privately printed by order of Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan_, 2 vols., New York, 1904-1911: 2:82, no. 1340, this piece is said to have come from the imperial collection.  The records, however, do not make clear which vase is which.  A letter dated 1 November 1934 from Duveen Brothers concerning the Morgan piece (in NGA curatorial files), states that Yan Li San might have been a member of the imperial family, noting that Clarke, who worked on the second volume of the Morgan collection, in which this vessel is catalogued, ""may have had means of identifying Yan Li San as a member of the imperial family, but omitted to mention the name in the catalogue.""  This suggests that Duveen Brothers had the impression that both vases had their origin in the same figure, a member of the imperial family.  However, a plausible candiate as the former owner of at least one, if not both, of these vases is the high official of Mongol background, Yang Lishan (c. 1900), who served in the Imperial Household Department (Neiwu Fu).  This might account for imperial associations surrounding the Morgan vase if indeed its origin was also with him.  Eventually Yang became a president of the Board of Revenue (Hubu Shangshu), which could have been interpreted as ""treasurer of the Chinese empire.""  His biography is in Erxun Zhao, et al., _Qing Shigao [Draft Standard History of Qing]_, Taipei, 1981: 18 juan 466, p. 12,763.  Yang was known for what were thought to be proforeign views, and was executed 11 August 1900 after protesting against the encouragement of the antiforeign Boxers.  Only a few days later the Allied Expeditionary Forces entered Beijing.  Perhaps these vases were among the booty reportedly taken from Yang's house by the French missionary Bishop Alphonse Favier (1837-1905), according to The Compilation Group, _History of Modern China: The Yi Ho Tuan Movement of 1900_, Beijing, 1976: 93, and then dispersed, eventually reaching Thomas B. Clarke in the United States along with the somewhat garbled name and occupation of their original owner.  Besides being a collector, Clarke imported and sold Chinese porcelains, and was familiar with Père Favier's collection, as shown in a note in Thomas B. Clarke and George B. Warren, _Catalogue of Antique Chinese Porcelains: Owned by George Warren of Troy, New York, with a note of introduction by Thomas B.

Klejman Gallery, New York); purchased around 30 November 1955 by Winston Guest, New York; gift 1955 to NGA.

[1] The sculpture cannot be precisely dated but is thought to have been made during the eighteenth century. It would have belonged to the ruling Oba, and then passed by descent to succeeding Obas. 

[2] According to the Sotheby’s, London, sales catalog of 5-6 July 1954, the object was “acquired by the present owner following on the Benin punitive expedition of 1897.”

[3] Cowan was a merchant from Liverpool who spent his career working for trading firms based in Nigeria. Although not known to have been a member of the British Punitive Expedition of 1897, he was possibly in Nigeria in 1897 (or shortly after) and may have come into possession of the object around that time through a member of the Expedition.

[1] In _Recollections of a Collector_, 1976, p. 56-57, Rosenwald described being approached by a young man in South America who offered to sell his father’s collection of prints that he had brought with him from Germany. Rosenwald gives the year as 1951, but his appointment books confirm that it was actually 1950 - he left for Buenos Aires on 9 February 1950 and returned on 20 March 1950 (Library of Congress, Rosenwald Papers, Box 75). Rosenwald writes that he bought the entire collection of some 1100 prints and drawings, but as they had already been scheduled to be sent to Europe they came to the United States via Antwerp, arriving in the US in late April 1950. Rosenwald decided to keep about a quarter of the collection, destined for the National Gallery of Art, and donate the remainder to other institutions. The inventory log of Alverthorpe indicates that just over 300 works were accessioned there in May of 1950, inventory numbers 50.260-50.530, acquired from Claude Schaefer (Gallery Archives, National Gallery of Art, RG 45A1, Rosenwald Papers, Box 41).",Rosenwald Collection,Print,,0.0,My Life: plate 7,My Life: plate 7,0.0,3977.0,3521.0,640.0,40061.0,,2718.0,2.0,500325128.0,"Rosenwald, Lessing Julius",Lessing Julius Rosenwald,Rosenwald,American,individual,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/bac0a8be-ae10-4892-ab08-e83611500ccc/full/full/0/default.jpg,0.709936288331886,United States,US,North America

Their account of that trip (Edith and Lessing Rosenwald, _Writing Paper Back_, [privately printed, 1958]) includes no visit to Africa or mention of the relief, although the book rarely discusses purchases. Elizabeth Mongan, an earlier Rosenwald curator, had never seen the relief and suggested that it must have been acquired after she left the position in 1962 (telephone conversation, 13 March 1985).",Rosenwald Collection,Sculpture,,0.0,,,1.0,8324.0,11654.0,,47212.0,,2100.0,1.0,,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian 18th/20th Century,Ethiopian,anonymous,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/18cee2f1-0a8b-4443-a387-f05324497f8b/full/full/0/default.jpg,9.756763876557424e-06,Ethiopia,ET,Africa

Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929. Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.

[1] The Duveen Brothers Records document the firm’s sixteen year pursuit and eventual acquisition of the Dreyfus collection, which included paintings, sculptures, small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes. Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929. Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.

[3] Cowan was a merchant from Liverpool who spent his career working for trading firms based in Nigeria.

Knoedler & Company, Inc., New York); purchased May 1956 by Paul Mellon, Upperville, Virginia; bequest 1999 to NGA.

[1] The artist's heirs were René De Gas, his last surviving brother, who lived in Paris, and the four (of seven) surviving children of his sister Marguerite, who had died in Argentina in 1895.  (His other deceased sister Thérèse left no descendants.) Marguerite's children were: Jeanne Fevre, unmarried and acting on both her own behalf and as the representative of her sister, Madeleine Marie Pauline Fevre, a Carmelite nun; Henri Jean Auguste Marie Fevre, an industrialist who lived in Marseille; and Gabriel Edgar Eugène Fevre, an agent in Montevideo, Uruguay.  See Anne Pingeot and Frank Horvat, _Degas sculptures_, Paris, 1991, and Anne Pingeot, ""The casting of Degas' sculptures: Completing the story,"" _Apollo_ (August 1995): 60-63.



[2] On 13 May 1918 a contract was signed between the artist's heirs and the Hébrard foundry authorizing the reproduction of Degas' sculptures in bronze.  Of the approximately 150 statuettes found in the artist's studio after his death, 74 figures were ultimately cast in bronze.  The contract stipulated that two complete sets were to be cast, one for the heirs and one for the foundry, and authorized a limit of twenty casts of each figure to be offered for sale.  The casting process took at least thirteen years, from 1919 to 1932, and according to the contract, the original figures became the property of the foundry.  See Sara Campbell, ""Degas' bronzes: Introduction,"" _Apollo_ (August 1995): 6-10.



[3] The article by Anne Pingeot referenced in note 1 provides details of the role of Hébrard's daughter in the history of the foundry, and its work in casting the bronzes.

Rosenwald; [1] gift 1950/1951 to the National Gallery of Art. 

[1] In _Recollections of a Collector_, 1976, p. 56-57, Rosenwald described being approached by a young man in South America who offered to sell his father’s collection of prints that he had brought with him from Germany. Rosenwald gives the year as 1951, but his appointment books confirm that it was actually 1950 - he left for Buenos Aires on 9 February 1950 and returned on 20 March 1950 (Library of Congress, Rosenwald Papers, Box 75). Rosenwald writes that he bought the entire collection of some 1100 prints and drawings, but as they had already been scheduled to be sent to Europe they came to the United States via Antwerp, arriving in the US in late April 1950. Rosenwald decided to keep about a quarter of the collection, destined for the National Gallery of Art, and donate the remainder to other institutions. The inventory log of Alverthorpe indicates that just over 300 works were accessioned there in May of 1950, inventory numbers 50.260-50.530, acquired from Claude Schaefer (Gallery Archives, National Gallery of Art, RG 45A1, Rosenwald Papers, Box 41).",Rosenwald Collection,Print,,0.0,,,0.0,2929.0,4000.0,,39566.0,,2547.0,1.0,500086297.0,"Mueller, Otto",Otto Mueller,Mueller,German,individual,https://api.nga.gov/iiif/394d5e45-4da0-4127-9620-9b15a95fac6f/full/full/0/default.jpg,0.0407637594762569,Germany,DE,Europe

[1] Based on the text of the handwritten note on the underside. The individual named there may be a baron de Monville whose titular property is in Gericault's native Seine-Maritime, around Rouen. He was well known in Paris in the 1860s as a collector of art bronzes and decorative arts, including a 45-centimeter sixteenth-century Italian human _écorché_. Many of his Italian bronzes were sold in a much-discussed (and as yet unidentified) sale in early February 1861 (Ernest Chesneau, ""Gericault. Le Mouvement moderne en peinture"" [offprint from _La Revue européenne_], Paris, 1861). He was later intimately involved in the efforts by the new applied-arts association (see the biography of Albert-Ernest Carrier-Belleuse) to found a ""retrospective museum of industrial arts"" similar to what is now the Victoria and Albert Museum, London (Charles Blanc, ""L'Union Centrale des Beaux-Arts"", _Gazette des Beaux Arts_ 7, 19 [1 September 1865]: 200, 204.)  No nineteenth-century sculpture is as yet identified with Monville. It is tempting to associate with him or his family the ""de Monville"" collection, with Renaissance and French romantic paintings, drawings, and decorative objects, that was sold in Paris 7-10 March 1837. The precise relationship of this little-known nineteenth-century collector with François Nicolas-Henri Racine de Jonquoy, baron de Monville (1734-1797), the designer, builder, and owner of the Désert de Retz, the celebrated ""psychological"" folly garden at the northern end of Marly Forest, is unclear. See Diana Ketcham, _Le Désert de Retz. A Late Eighteenth-Century Folly Garden, The Artful Landscape of Monsieur de Monville_, Cambridge and London, 1997.

[2] The bronze reportedly belonged to a ""M. Barre"" in charge of the Paris Mint in the late nineteenth century (letter of 26 May 1971 from Cyril Humphris to Paul Mellon [in NGA curatorial files]). Younger brother of the better-known sculptor Jean-Auguste Barre (1811-1896), Albert-Désiré became ""graveur général des monnaies"" in 1855, succeeding their father Jean-Jacques in that position (Stanislas Lami, _Dictionnaire des sculpteurs de l'école française au dix-neuvième siècle_, 4 vols., Paris, 1914-1921, Reprint Nendeln, Kraus, 1970: 1:36). The National Gallery bronze was reportedly purchased privately from the descendants at the cited date by a Paris dealer (verbal communication, 1989, from an anonymous dealer).

Kress Foundation, New York;[1] gift 1957 to NGA.


[1] The Duveen Brothers Records document the firm’s sixteen year pursuit and eventual acquisition of the Dreyfus collection, which included paintings, sculptures, small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes. Bequeathed as part of his estate to Dreyfus’ widow and five children (a son and four daughters), who had differing opinions about its disposition, the collection was not sold until after his widow’s death in April 1929. Duveen did not wish to separate Dreyfus’ collection of small bronzes, medals, and plaquettes, and it was sold intact to the Kress Foundation for a price that was met by installment payments every three months.
