The attribution in all the deeds of gifts and all acknowledgements and correspondence from the Gallery to the donor and her representative refer to the relief as ""by Verrocchio.""  A memo of 3 June 1959 to all staff from Perry Cott directs a ""change of attribution"" from ""Attributed to Verrocchio"" to ""Andrea del Verrocchio.""
